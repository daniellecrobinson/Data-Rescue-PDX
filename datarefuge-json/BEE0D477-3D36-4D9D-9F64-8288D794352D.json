	"Type(s) of content in package": "Total deposition maps and the underlying data have been produced using wet deposition measurements from the\nNADP National Trends Network (NTN) and estimates of dry deposition using a method that combines ambient air\nmonitoring data with output from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. This method of\nestimating dry deposition gives priority to measurement data near the location of the monitor and priority to\nCMAQ data in areas where monitoring data are not available. Additionally, CMAQ output is used for species such\nas peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN), dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrous acid\n(HONO) and organic nitrate that are not routinely measured, but likely contribute a significant amount to the total\nnitrogen budget. The sections below provide details on the monitoring and modeling data and methodology. In\nthe final section, notes and caveats are provided that discuss limitations of the data. Note that this product is\ndynamic and will be updated as new monitoring and modeling data become available and as improvements to the\nmethodology are implemented. Therefore, it is critical to note the version number associated with the data. The\nversion number consists of a 4-digit year and a 2-digit release number. The data described below is denoted as\nversion 2016.01.",
