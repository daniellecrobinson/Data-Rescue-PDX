## Issues
Share your thoughts, we call them "Issues". Think of issues as **conversation starters**. They're a way of communicating across all the members of the team. And for this project, Issues are where you will deposit the metadata you've created. 

Like you're saying: 
:wave: **HEY EVERYONE! CHECK THIS OUT!** :wave:

Then a few people will check your metadata to give you :thumbsup: :thumbsup:, adding an additional level of validation.

For this project, we are using issues to track contributions. Later we can extract the all data from the all the issues you create.  If you have a question or concern, you can add an issue not related to metadata and tag the organizers or ping us on Slack (see [Get in touch](#how-to-get-in-touch) below). GitHub has a nice set of help pages if you're looking for more information about [discussing projects in issues][link_discussingissues].

You can find all currently open conversations under the [issues tab](https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/Data-Rescue-PDX/issues).

## Recognizing contributions

If you're logged into GitHub you can see everyone who has contributed to the repository via our [live contributors page](https://labhr.github.io/hatrack/#repo=daniellecrobinson/Data-Rescue-PDX). 

These pages are powered by the [Let's all build a hat rack][link_hatrackhome] project, and we love them. 

Quoting from their [website][link_hatrackhome]:

> Open Source project contribution focuses a lot on the code committed to projects, but there is so much more that goes on behind the scenes that is just as valuable to FOSS than the code itself.
> 
> LABHR seeks to find those that provide these non-code contributions, and thank them. 
>
> LABHR started as an [idea by Leslie Hawthorn][link_hatrackidea]. She advocates openly thanking people on social media, and writing recommendations.
>
> This idea was extended by Katie McLaughlin with her work on [automating this process on GitHub][link_hatrackcontributions]. 

## How to get in touch

If you have a question or a comment we'd love for you to [open an issue](https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/Data-Rescue-PDX/issues) and tag an organizer in your issue.
