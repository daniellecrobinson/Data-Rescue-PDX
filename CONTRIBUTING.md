Draft of new workflow engaging with Data Refuge DCR 2017/02/21

1. Pull from Data Refuge Archiver sources in the research bin -> do we pull out a big list for people to work with?

2. Get Archiver ID of dataset you want to work on

3. [Add it to google speadspreadsheet at the event -> or to make more secure, fill out a gooogle formt aht auto populates a spreadhsset of datasets other people have started]

4. Research your dataset

5. Find or create JSON metadata for your "bag"

6. have participants dump their metadata into their issue

7. upstream the metadata from these issues (Exported) into archivers.space eventually
