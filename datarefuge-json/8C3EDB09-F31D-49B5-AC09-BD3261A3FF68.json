  "Type(s) of content in package":"The electric power data collected by EIA surveys are, for the most part, not proprietary and are available in these files at the level of plants, generators, and companies. Examples of the available data include generation by plant and prime mover for each fuel consumed; retail sales by sector, seller and state; and the quality and volumes of fossil fuels delivered to power plants. Aggregated data tables and graphical displays are available through the Electricity Data Browser, Electric Power Monthly, and the Electric Power Annual. In addition, the Electricity Monthly Update provides an overview of power market trends using EIA and other data.\n\nSpecifically, the following datasets are downloaded:\n---State-level data (consolidated across forms)\nContains electricity generation; fuel consumption; emissions; retail sales, revenue, number of customers, and retail prices; generating capacity; and financial data.\n---Electric power sales and revenue data—monthly (Form EIA-826)\nRetail sales of electricity and associated revenue by end-use sector, green pricing, net metering, State, and reporting month. \n\n---Electric power sales, revenue and energy efficiency data—annual (Form EIA-861)\nElectricity sales, revenues, and customer counts, peak load, electric purchases, and energy efficiency and demand-side management programs, green pricing and net metering programs, and distributed generation capacity.\n\n--- Electric generator capacity data—annual (Form EIA-860)\nElectric utility and non-utility generator-specific plant data, including in-service date, prime movers, generating capacity, energy sources, existing and proposed generators, county and state location, ownership, and FERC qualifying facility status.\n\n--- Electric generator capacity data—monthly (Form EIA-860M)\nPreliminary generator-specific data, including in-service date, prime movers, generating capacity, energy sources, and reporting entity. \n\n--- Power plant operating data (Form EIA-923 with predecessor Forms EIA-920, 906, 423 and FERC-423) \nContains data on electricity generation, fuel consumption, useful thermal output, fossil fuel stocks, fuel deliveries, quantity delivered, supplier, coal mine type, Btu, sulfur, and ash content, and receipts at the power plant and prime mover level.
