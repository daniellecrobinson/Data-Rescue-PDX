## Principles

- Any open data set requires a **chain of custody** so it can be used for research in the future.
- Use Data Rescue Events to **build local networks** of librarians and technologists working together to set up a sustainable effort.
- **Metadata must be considered upfront**, before any archiving takes place. By creating **high quality metadata** we will enabling high quality archiving.
- Collaboration should take place on **open platforms that allow anyone to contribute**.
- Embody **open source and open science values** and focus on lowering barriers to contribute.
- Librarians will ultimately be in control of the process, and set the standard for metadata quality as **they are expert data and metadata curators**.
- Encourage **lots of copies** of data housed in lots of institutions

## Goals

- **Minimize maintenance bottleneck** for organizers, e.g. libraries should be able to move forward without being blocked by infrastructure.
- Enable many groups to produce **high quality metadata** in parallel.
- Meaningfully **engage large numbers of volunteers** at events.
- Encourage **local long term community building**, overlapping libraries and Data Refuge groups
- **Empower librarians to assume curatorial roles supported by DataRefuge community**.
- Libraries can host what data they can, and coordinate with others to **ensure good coverage**


Draft of new workflow engaging with Data Refuge DCR 2017/02/21

1. Pull from Data Refuge Archiver sources in the research bin -> do we pull out a big list for people to work with?

2. Get Archiver ID of dataset you want to work on

3. [Add it to google speadspreadsheet at the event -> or to make more secure, fill out a gooogle formt aht auto populates a spreadhsset of datasets other people have started]

4. Research your dataset

5. Find or create JSON metadata for your "bag"

6. have participants dump their metadata into their issue

7. upstream the metadata from these issues (Exported) into archivers.space eventually


ALso hey, this is cool! https://labhr.github.io/hatrack/#repo=daniellecrobinson/Data-Rescue-PDX
