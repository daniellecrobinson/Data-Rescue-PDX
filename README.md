Volunteers

DataRefuge is really committed to making citable copies with clearly documented chains of custody. 



My process has been working with Data.gov's metadata format (data.json). I have been working with them to produce a full copy of their metadata archive and a process for reporting missing data: https://www.data.gov/developers/archiving

Google also recently did a great post about using the Data.gov metadata format for discovery of datasets: https://research.googleblog.com/2017/01/facilitating-discovery-of-public.html

My current goal is to have a process to mirror all metadata onto Internet Archive who has good preservation features and work with groups building distributed data distribution and access tools.

For people writing custom scrapers I want to work on ways to publish metadata for what they scraped onto Internet Archive and the DataRefuge CKAN so it can be discovered and referenced by other volunteers.
