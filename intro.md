## Background
### Major players
- **[Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)** - basically an repository of the consistent metadata - "it's just the phone book, not the actual houses."
- **[DataRefuge](https://www.datarefuge.org/) (UPENN)** - committed to making citable copies with clearly documented chains of custody, so let's help with that. 
- **[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/index.php)** & **[Archive Team](http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)** - basically a hard drive, doing wayback machine for all nominated websites BUT it's just a crawl, it will miss a lot of data because the bots are dumb
- **UC system** - a bunch of simultaneous projects on storing and archiving data
 - **California Digital Library** - another harddrive, but with metadata expertise
 - **UC Riverside** - **[Azimuth](http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+Climate+Data+Backup+Project)** data rescue project
 - **UC Davis** - **[Climate-mirror](http://climatemirror.org/)** data rescue project
 
### Wider Community Involvent
 - You're now part of a multi-city, multi-institutal effort to catalog and archive data
