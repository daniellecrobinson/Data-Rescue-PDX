Volunteers! Welcome and thank you for spending your evening with us.

DataRefuge is really committed to making citable copies with clearly documented chains of custody - so let's help with that. 

- Citable copies = discoverable! So your copy can be found and used by others, for instance on the Internet Archive
- Clearly documented chains of custody = To prove that your copy is the same data as the original, so you want to reference the webpage that you found it on and data.gov metatdata ID to link back to where you found the data.

## Background

At this hackathon we'll be focusing on the [Climate Mirror](https://github.com/climate-mirror/how-to-help) effort.
Here are the [Climate Mirror Datasets](https://github.com/climate-mirror/datasets/issues), each issue links out to a dataset
  
### [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/about)

 - "Agencies are required to publish a list of their data assets that are public, or could be made public. This list is made available as a data.json file hosted at the primary domain of the agency."
 - So, working with the JSON files, we can see what public datasets exist.
 
### Working with [JSON](http://www.json.org/)?

 - JavaScript Object Notation
 - data-interchange format fo text-only data 
 - Language-independent way to organize information so that humans and machines can read it!

Take some time with this guide to [JSON Lines](https://github.com/jsonlines/guide) to familiarize yourself with Data.gov's metadata format (data.json). This guide will help you:

1. Download tools you'll need to play around with JSON files
2. Work in the command line with JSON Lines Command Line Interface (CLI) Tools 
3. If you've never worked in the terminal before - don't worry! 
  - This will be fun! This is your crash course! 
  - Here's a [CLI cheatsheet](https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/terminal-mac-cheatsheet), and | is a [pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix))!
  - You'll do great!


Metadata is super important, and if all you do today is create metadata files, that is AWESOME and necessary.

Google also recently did a great post about using the Data.gov metadata format for discovery of datasets: https://research.googleblog.com/2017/01/facilitating-discovery-of-public.html

At this hackathon we'll be focusing on the [Climate Mirror](https://github.com/climate-mirror/how-to-help) effort.

## When you're ready to go

1. Adopt a dataset from [Climate-mirror](https://github.com/climate-mirror/datasets/issues)
2. Find out if and who has a copy of it
3. If it does not have a metadata file created for it, create one!
4. Check if it's on Data.gov, if not report it as a unlisted dataset

Is your data set missing form Data.gov? [Max](https://github.com/maxogden) has been working with them to produce a full copy of their metadata archive and a process for [reporting missing data](https://www.data.gov/developers/archiving)
