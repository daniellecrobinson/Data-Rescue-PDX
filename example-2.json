Regarding chemical or biological entities that by law must be submitted to the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for pre-marketing approval, only those entities that actually have been approved by FDA using New Drug Application (NDA), Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), or biologics license, may be added to the VA National Formulary.",
