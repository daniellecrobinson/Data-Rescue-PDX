# Contributing to Data Rescue PDX

Welcome to the Data Rescue PDX GitHub repository,!

The point of this file is to make it easy for you to get involved. So if you have any questions that aren't covered here please let us know! Check out the [Share your thoughts](#share-your-thoughts) section below for more details.

Before you start you'll need to set up a free [GitHub][link_github] account and sign in. Here are some [instructions][link_signupinstructions].

Scroll down or jump to one of the following sections:

* [Share your thoughts](#share-your-thoughts)
  * [Labels](#labels)
* [Recognising contributions](#recognising-contributions)
* [Get in touch](#how-to-get-in-touch)

## Share your thoughts, we call them "Issues"

Although GitHub calls them **issues**, we'd like you to think of them as **conversation starters**. They're our way of communicating across all the members of the team. And for this project, Issues are where you will deposit the metadata you've created.

(If you're here you ***already are*** a member of the team.)

GitHub has a nice set of help pages if you're looking for more information about [discussing projects in issues][link_discussingissues].

### Labels

You can find all currently open conversations under the [issues tab][https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/Data-Rescue-PDX/issues].

The current list of labels are [here][https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/Data-Rescue-PDX/labels] 
**Add more on labels**

**Success!!** :balloon::balloon::balloon: Well done! And thank you :smiley::tada::sparkles:

## Recognizing contributions

If you're logged into GitHub you can see everyone who has contributed to the repository via our [live contributors page][https://labhr.github.io/hatrack/#repo=daniellecrobinson/Data-Rescue-PDX]. 

These pages are powered by the [Let's all build a hat rack][link_hatrackhome] project, and we love them. 

Quoting from their [website][link_hatrackhome]:

> Open Source project contribution focuses a lot on the code committed to projects, but there is so much more that goes on behind the scenes that is just as valuable to FOSS than the code itself.
> 
> LABHR seeks to find those that provide these non-code contributions, and thank them. 
>
> LABHR started as an [idea by Leslie Hawthorn][link_hatrackidea]. She advocates openly thanking people on social media, and writing recommendations.
>
> This idea was extended by Katie McLaughlin with her work on [automating this process on GitHub][link_hatrackcontributions]. 

## How to get in touch

If you have a question or a comment we'd love for you to [open an issue][https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/Data-Rescue-PDX/issues] because that will be our fastest way of communicating, getting the answers to you and (if necessary) making a change.

You can also join our theScience Hack PDX Slack to chat after this event or contact the organizers: https://sciencepdxslackin.herokuapp.com/
