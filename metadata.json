The return signal, typically a few photons, is collected by a telescope and the time-of-flight is measured. Using information about the satellite's orbit, the time-of-flight, and the speed of light, the location of the ranging station can be determined. Similar data acquired by another station, many kilometers distant from the first, or on a different continent, can be used to determine the distance between stations to precisions of centimeters or better. Repetitive measurements over months and years yield the change in distance, or the motion of the Earth's crust.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"ftp://cddis.gsfc.nasa.gov/slr/data","mediaType":"application/octet-stream"}],"identifier":"C1000000041-CDDIS__2","isPartOf":"C1000000041-CDDIS","issued":"1982-01-01T00:00:00","keyword":["EARTH SCIENCES"],"landingPage":"http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb?selected=C1000000041-CDDIS","language":["en-US"],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","modified":"2012-06-14T00:00:00","programCode":["026:001"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"spatial":"-180.0, -90.0, 180.0, 90.0","temporal":"R/1976-01-02T00:00:00Z/P1D","theme":["ILRS"],"title":"CDDIS_SLR_data"}

Two statistical downscaling methods, the daily Bias-Corrected Spatial Downscaling (BCSD) and the Multivariate Adapted Constructed Analogs (MACA), that directly incorporate daily data were validated over the Western United States with reanalysis data. While both methods outperformed the null interpolation only method, MACA exhibited additional skill in temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation due to its ability to jointly downscale temperature and dew point temperature and its use of analog patterns rather than interpolation. Both downscaling methods exhibited value added information in tracking fire danger indices and periods of extreme fire danger; however, due to its ability to more accurately capture relative humidity and winds, MACA outperformed the daily BCSD.","license_id":"","organization":{"description":"","created":"","title":"Idaho EPSCoR Office","name":"","is_organization":true,"image_url":"","type":"organization","id":""},"resources":[{"url":"http://climate.nkn.uidaho.edu/MACA/data_catalogs.php","describedBy":"http://climate.nkn.uidaho.edu/MACA/index.php","hash":"","description":"","format":"netCDF","mimetype":"application/x-netcdf","name":"","created":""}]}

The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)was launched aboard the EOS-Aura satellite on July 15, 2004(1:38 pm equator crossing time, ascending mode). OMI with its 2600 km viewing swath width provides almost daily global coverage. OMI is a contribution of the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programs (NIVR)in collaboration with Finish Meterological Institute (FMI), to the US EOS-Aura Mission. The principal investigator's (Dr. Pieternel Levelt) institute is the KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute). OMI is designed to monitor stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, clouds, aerosols and smoke from biomass burning, SO2 from volcanic eruptions, and key tropospheric pollutants (HCHO, NO2) and ozone depleting gases (OClO and BrO). OMI sensor counts, calibrated and geolocated radiances, and all derived geophysical atmospheric products will be archived at the NASA Goddard DAAC. This level-2 global total column ozone product (OMTO3)is based on the enhanced TOMS version-8 algorithm that  essentially uses the ultraviolet radiance data at 317.5 and 331.2 nm. OMI additional hyper-spectral measurements help in the corrections for the factors that induce uncertainty in ozone retrieval (e.g., cloud and aerosol, sea-glint effects, profile shape sensitivity, SO2 and other trace gas contamination). In addition to the total ozone values this product also contains some auxiliary derived and ancillary input parameters including N-values, effective Lambertian scene-reflectivity, UV aerosol index, SO2 index, cloud fraction, cloud pressure, ozone below clouds, terrain height, geolocation, solar and satellite viewing angles, and extensive quality flags. The shortname for this Level-2 OMI total column ozone product is OMTO3 and the algorithm lead for this product is NASA OMI scientist  Dr. Pawan K. Bhartia ( Pawan.K.Bhartia@nasa.gov). OMTO3 files are stored in EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (~53 minutes). There are approximately 14 orbits per day. The maximum file size for the OMTO3 data product is about 35 Mbytes. A list of tools for browsing and extracting data from these files can be found at: http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/tools.shtml For more information on Ozone Monitoring Instrument and atmospheric data products, please visit the OMI-Aura sites: http://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/  http://www.knmi.nl/omi/research/documents/ .

There are data for several weeks on each tape, with no ephemeris data on any of the tapes. Two intervals of several hours each (13 October and 27 November 1967) have been found when, because of apparent keypunch errors in the experimenter's data processing cycle, the sign of Bz (and, hence, of the field latitude angle) is opposite what it should be. These errors appeared when comparing these data to the experimenter's IMP-D data and to data from the other IMP-D magnetometer. It is not known what percentage of the data is affected by similar errors, although this percentage is expected to be small.","license_id":null,"organization":{"title":"NASA","name":"nasa","is_organization":true}}
