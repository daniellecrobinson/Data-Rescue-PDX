### Working with [JSON](http://www.json.org/) to make [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/about)-friendly metadata

- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is: Language-independent way to organize information so that humans and machines can read it!
- "Agencies are required to publish a list of their data assets that are public, or could be made public. This list is made available as a data.json file hosted at the primary domain of the agency."
- So, working with the JSON files, we can see what public datasets exist.

Take some time with this guide to [JSON Lines](https://github.com/jsonlines/guide) to familiarize yourself with Data.gov's metadata format (data.json). This guide will help you:

1. Download tools you'll need to play around with JSON files
2. Work in the command line with JSON Lines Command Line Interface (CLI) Tools 
3. If you've never worked in the terminal before - don't panic! 
  - This will be fun! This is your crash course! 
  - Here's a [CLI cheatsheet](https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/terminal-mac-cheatsheet), and | is a [pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix))!
  - You'll do great! Ask for help when you get stuck :)

OK, now that you've run through that, you should feel more comfortable sorting through a JSON file for information about dataset contents, ownership, licensing, size, and other important info.
